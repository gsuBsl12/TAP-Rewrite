# TAP Rewrite

The main menu can be launched through the main.py file. The functionality for this is in both the menu.py and backend.py files. The backend.py file is responsible for managing the experiment files.

The code for gauging the user's reaction time under the Spacebar Test.py (Spacebar\ Test.py) file.

The code for selecting a shock level and having the gauge update accordingly is in the Shock Selection.py (Shock\ Selection.py) file.

The code for interfacing with the Ni DAQ card is in the shock.py file. This contains a function for triggering a shock with a certain strength for a certain time interval.

A more comprehensive overview can be found in the Quickstart.docx file. The main issue to resolve is the matter of the shock selection and reaction test being merged.
