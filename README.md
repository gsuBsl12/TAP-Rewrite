Taylor Aggression Paradigm GUI

# TAP-GUI

[Taylor Aggression Paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Aggression_Paradigm) (TAP) GUI

This is a Windows GUI written entirely in Python for conducting TAP experiments. This software uses the following resources:

- [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) for menus and interfaces
- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) for subject interaction interface
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) & [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for data collection and formatting
- [nidaqmx](https://nidaqmx-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for interfacing with DAQ card

The software is built to interface with the [NI-DAQ USB-6001](https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/model/usb-6001.html). This DAQ card serves as an electrical signal processor and sends a digital and analog signal to the [Coulbourn Precision-Regulated Programmable Shocker](https://www.harvardapparatus.com/media/manuals/Product%20Manuals/H13-15,%20-16%20Aninal%20Shocker%20Manual.pdf).
